# Double Pendulum (Python)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a double pendulum system. It uses the following equations, solved using the forward Euler's method, to model the physical system:

## Features

- 3 colorful pendulums start with small mass perturbations across initial states.
- Clear visualization of the dynamical system's chaos. 
- Real-time rendering and realistic physics displayed within the pygame window.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries which are compiled into the main.exe:

- pygame
- math
- sys

## Building and Running

### Windows

1. Download the .zip file by pressing the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".
2. Extract all components of the .zip file.
3. Navigate to the folder titled "dist" and run the main.exe

## Example

Animation generated by main.exe with 3 pendulums starting at the same position but differing in mass by 1 unit each:
